## My ZSH Theme Customization

### Usages
- Close the repository or just copy the `macos_terminal.zsh-theme` file to the `/home/[username]/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` path.

### Notes
- I made this in my free time, based on the source code of other themes. I use it now, and I especially like it because *I made it*-it makes me feel cool.
